# Credit_Banking
In this project, I analyzed credit card transaction data for Edulyt India using Python. The goal was to understand customer spending patterns, repayment behavior, and identify profitable segments. I performed data cleaning tasks, calculated various monthly metrics, and analyzed spending and repayment trends across different customer segments and age groups.
